# docker-backuppc-S3Archive

This extends the already wonderful docker BackupPC image by adferrand (https://github.com/adferrand/docker-backuppc) by adding the BackupPC S3 Archive scripts created by rtucker (https://github.com/rtucker/backuppc-archive-s3)

All credit goes to the work of the developers of the existing projects
